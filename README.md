# Exoplanet-Artificial-Intelligence-Project
This project uses neural networks in Python to predict whether an exoplanet is a terrestrial or gas giant, given the planetary radius and orbital period.
To use this program, run it, then enter the value for a planet's radius multiplied by 0.0001 and orbital period multiplied by 0.01 when prompted. The program will output whether a given exoplanet is a terrestrial or gas giant.
To find exoplanets to test, go over to NASA's Exoplanet Catalog https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/discovery/exoplanet-catalog/ and select either "Terrestrial" or "Gas Giant" under the Planet Type checklist.
